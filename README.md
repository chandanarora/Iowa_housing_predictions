#### Predicting the price of houses in Iowa using Decision Tree and Random Forest

This project predicts the housing prices in Iowa based on the features such as Lot Area, year built, Bath area, rooms above ground floor, etc.
The data set can been on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/nickptaylor/iowa-house-prices)
### Decision Tree has been chosen to predict the prices and evaluate mean absolute error. 
The dataset is divided into training and testing data using train_test_split for validation.
#### max_leaf_nodes argument is used to take care of underfitting and overfitting of data.

### In order to further improve the accuracy of predictions, Random Forest algorithm has been used.

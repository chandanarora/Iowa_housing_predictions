#### Predicting the price of houses in Iowa using Decision Tree and Random Forest

This project predicts the housing prices in Iowa based on the features such as Lot Area, year built, Bath area, rooms above ground floor, etc.

### Decision Tree has been chosen to predict the prices and evaluate mean absolute error. 

### In order to improve the accuracy of predictions, Random Forest algorithm is used.
